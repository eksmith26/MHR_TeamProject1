        <p id="paragraphText">
          Musk spoke to the media and acknowledged that workers have been “having a hard time, working long hours, and
          on hard jobs” followed by a counter argument that we are not “greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on
          safety in order to have more profits and dividends” because we are a “money losing company.”

        <h5>The investigation into falsified injury reports</h5>
        <p id="paragraphText">In 2020, we updated our website to include the measures we’ve taken to increase safety for
          workers on the floor. Here we cite the statistics on the standard injury count for the industry in comparison
          to our factories based in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

          This was a good way for the company to prove that, while it’s not ok, Tesla reports less injuries per year on
          average than all other automotive industry competitors. We are going to choose these numbers as correct
          because there has been no formal trial proving falsification.
          However, investigative journalism site Reveal is claiming that Tesla falsified these reports based on
          anecdotal evidence from employees</p>
