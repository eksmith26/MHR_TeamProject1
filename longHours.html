        <p id="paragraphText">Ex factory workers explained Tesla’s working schedule as follows; Tesla operates on an
          alternating schedule of 3-4-4-3 working days, with a minimum of 10 hours per day and often pushing up to 12
          hours per day (sometimes mandatory). It’s not uncommon for employees to work 5 or 6 days a week, including
          weekends and holidays.

        <p id="paragraphText">Tesla’s work schedule is unusual not just among businesses but among the automotive
          industry. 10 hours for four days is standard in the automotive industry, 12 hours is not, as employees will
          lose efficiency because such long times wear people out.

        <p id="paragraphText">
          Some of the effects of a supra - 40 hour workweek on the body include,
          Heart disease, hypertension, anxiety, lack of sleep and bad habits.
        </p>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p id="paragraphText">The expectation at Tesla is that you work over 40 hours a week, which creates a lot of
          pressure on having to
          work a lot every day. It’s difficult enough to get a job at Tesla. The stress level at Tesla will depend on
          the team or a manager and how much they allow their team to burn out during crunch times. Thus the stress
          level at Tesla is heavily dependent on the specific role and department that you’re in.
