				<p id="paragraphText">With support from many large Unions including the largest auto workers union, the
					UAW, Tesla Workers
					Union has tried to unionize within Tesla for a while. Initially this group complained of being fired
					for
					being associated with this group and wearing pro Union clothes were even banned in the Tesla dress
					code.</p>

				<p id="paragraphText">According to a CNN article The UAW fears that Tesla is their biggest threat to
					wages and growth
					simply because Tesla was the standard for Electric Vehicles so if the standard was never unionized
					if the future of the vehicle industry heads electric it could also be the end of unions in the
					automotive Industry.</p>

				<p id="paragraphText">Musk has spoken out against unions and even has a tweet saying, "Nothing stopping
					Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union
					dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &
					everybody already gets healthcare,". This tweet was deemed unfair union busting practices by the
					NLRB and to be deleted, which it never was. All these anti union practices presented by Elon Musk
					and other members at Tesla have always kept representation incredibly low.
