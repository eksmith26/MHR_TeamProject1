                <p id="paragraphText">Since breaking through as the worldwide leader in the electric vehicle market, CEO
                    Elon Musk and our company as a whole have often found ourselves under scrutiny for instilling an
                    “extremely hardcore and intense” work culture onto our employees. While there are many reasons as to
                    why this may be, one aspect that greatly contributes to this “hardcore” culture is the lack of job
                    security that employees experience while working for us. This is not ideal, as this feeling often
                    leads employees to become increasingly stressed and dissatisfied with their working conditions.

                <p id="paragraphText">As a company that prides ourselves on innovation and change, it is important that
                    we ask ourselves the question of just how much change is too much. In 2021, Tesla replaced a
                    considerable 40% of its entire workforce. While this may seem high, this number was actually an
                    improvement from 2018, where Tesla replaced an astonishing 70% of it’s workforce. With turnover
                    rates this high, it is no wonder that our employees have begun to question their job security.
